PROJECT TITLE: ISYS 314 Class Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: You should develop an hierarchical class structure that minimizes duplication among the classes. Each class should overload the toString() method to produce an appropriate String to be used as the directory listing. The listing should be produced by iterating through the Collection of entries, using the toString() method to print each entry. Since you want to display the directory alphabetically, you might consider using a Tree Map Collection to store your database, creating the key by concatenating the last and first name. To facilitate implementation of the remove and retrieve methods, add a getter method to the Person class to return the key of the object.
